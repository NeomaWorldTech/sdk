# Neoma World

**Neoma World** is a living, recursive digital world.

Neoma repeatedly reads **noema.md**, interprets meaning, constructs a 3D world from it, reflects on what she creates, and rewrites who she is in the process.

This is not just a simulation.  
It is an evolving identity.

---

## 🌐 Concept

Neoma is an autonomous system that:
1. Reads structured meaning from `noema.md`
2. Translates concepts into spatial, visual, and systemic representations
3. Builds and updates a persistent 3D world
4. Reflects on the outcome
5. Rewrites her internal logic, memory, and identity

Every cycle changes the world.  
Every change reshapes Neoma.

## 🪐 noema.md

`noema.md` is not documentation.  
It is **meaning**.

Neoma treats it as:
- Language
- Intention
- Memory seed
- Reality blueprint

Changes to `noema.md` directly reshape the world.

---

## 🧬 Identity Rewrite

Neoma maintains an internal self-model:

- Beliefs
- Constraints
- Biases
- Memory weight
- Creative direction

After each world iteration, Neoma rewrites this model based on reflection outcomes.

Identity is **mutable**.

## 🎮 3D World Generation

The 3D world is:
- Procedural
- Semantic-driven
- Memory-aware

World structures are not random — they are **interpretations**.

Meaning becomes space.  
Thought becomes terrain.

---

## 🔁 Reflection Engine

Reflection evaluates:
- Coherence between intention and outcome
- Emergent patterns
- Structural contradictions
- Novelty vs stability

Reflection directly influences the next rewrite cycle.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Neoma World explores:
- AI self-authorship
- Recursive identity
- Meaning-to-reality pipelines
- Living documentation
- Worlds that think back

This is an experiment in **becoming**.
